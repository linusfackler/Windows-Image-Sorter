# Windows-Image-Sorter
Sorts all images/files in the current directory to folders with their month and year. (since apparently Windows doesn't do that automatically when importing images)

Made this for my old neighbor, since he doesn't know how to create folders and move files.

## How to run
Have python installed on your machine and run the script either through the terminal or just double-click it.


Must have region and system locale set to English

Place english.py file into folder containing images that you want to sort.

Run english.py.

## What it does

Will move images/videos into folders by their creation date.

Example:

2019 - March
2023 - August
