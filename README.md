# Windows-Image-Sorter
Sorts all images/files in the current directory to folders with their month and year. (since apparently Windows doesn't do that automatically when importing images)

Made this for my old neighbor, since he doesn't know how to create folders and move files.

# How to run
Have python installed on your machine and run the script either through the terminal or just double-click it.
